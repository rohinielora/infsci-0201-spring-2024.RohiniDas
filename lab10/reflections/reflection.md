# Reflections on Streamlit vs. Flask

## How does Streamlit differ from Flask?
Streamlit is tailored for building interactive data apps with minimal setup, automating UI and state management. Flask provides more flexibility, suitable for developing custom web services and applications with detailed control over routes and responses.

## When would you use Flask instead of Streamlit?
Flask is ideal for creating APIs and web applications requiring complex backend logic and user authentication. Streamlit excels at quickly prototyping data-driven apps where the main focus is on visualizing and interacting with data.
